# 2021 Advent of Code

## About
This is my first year of participating in Advent of Code! I have heard about it years ago in vague details, and I am really looking forward to participating this year.

I will be solving this year's puzzles using **C#** and **.Net 6.0**. I will also be using the Visual Studio 2022, which I just recently downloaded. This could be a great opportunity to have fun and explore the new Visual Studio.

## Goals
- Earn 50 stars
- Play around VS2022
- Discover new stuff in .Net 6.0
